## Description


The goal of this week's task is to improve the accesibility of the Horiseon website to ensure that people with disabilities can are not disadvantaged or excluded when browsing the website. This practise also helps increase the website's search engine ranking. This will be done by refactoring existing code to meet a certain set of standards. This task teaches us to implement our new knowlege and skills, and gain insight into the role of a front end developer.


## Installation

The project can be accessed through my GitHub Reposity via the following link:

git@github.com:Nafisa06/refactor-website-accessibility.git. 

The following link can be used to view the refactored website on the browser:
 file:///C:/Users/asifa/bootcamp/homework/refactor-website-accessibility/index.html


The final product shows better contrast between the text and background, larger text and better spacing. These improve the accesibility of the website.
